# NamePuzzle
Worked on a small project to achieve the objectives. I wrote the App in Swift.

1. Present a simple form for a person. The form lets a user enter a person's first name and last name then generates a full name and displays that in a label.
2. Use Auto layout. Form should work on all iPhone Sizes
3. Update the code that generates the full name to accept a parameter that controls the way a full name is generated (first name first: first_name last_name, last name first: last_name, first_name`). Add a UI widget so the form can choose which style to use.
4. Create a new view controller that when presented loads this data as a collection of people and presents them in a table. Update the app to load this new view by default.
5. Write test cases against the fullName method on the main view controller.
